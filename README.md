### ITFest 2018 Hackathon - PWA challenge in partnership with Accenture
### 3rd place
The objective of the 24 hour hackathon was to develop a progressive web platform that can help students to manage their assignments. <br>
After a day of planning and development, the current app, which we called **neverlate**, was created. <br>
The app is not finished and it's in a hackathon *implement-as-much-as-you-can* state :smile: <br>
We used this repository during the competition day.
